		<h2>Professional Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal for my career is to be able to make websites professionall; either for a company or freelance. Taking these classes and getting
            my associate's degree in Web Design will be useful.</p>

        <p>My plan is to get a job as a junior developer or web assistant, then hopefully go into IT. After that, I would work as a freelance web designer or work for
            a big company.</p>
